      Hello there! I’m Brittany and welcome to my little seasonal food blog. I’m a Midwestern girl (she/her) in my late twenties who now lives in the PNW with my sweetheart ham, Adam. We own a small home-trying-to-be-a-homestead in Portland, Oregon where I keep trying to convince him to let me get chickens and a cat.
      </p>
      <p>
      I started this blog in 2017 as a way to journal online for everyone to laugh along with me as I learned lessons in life and love the hard way. I needed to work on my shit so that I could learn how to celebrate LIFE and show up for others the way I wanted to.
      </p>
      <p>
      Today, I’m over here very much still working on my shit…but this time, putting all my feelings into food. Seasonal food! I’m an avid home-baker, rebel gardener, and known for throwing weird food gatherings. I’m always wondering how to make that thing from scratch. I love geeking out ab");
            WriteLiteral(@"out homesteading, food preservation, and coming up with recipes for whatever is growing at the moment.

      I started cooking and baking by picking a few cookbooks and GOING. FOR. IT. I made my way through cookbooks and hosted cooking clubs with friends until I had a decent understanding of what I was doing. This food blog is full of mistakes. I’m here to encourage people to use what they have and to have fun experimenting. Some of my favorite meals have involved me subbing in random ingredients and hoping it remains edible. Trust!
      </p>
      <p>
      I’m also over here trying to do my part as a privileged white woman and home cook with access to grocery stores, ingredients, a kitchen, stove, pantry, garden, tools, time, and money. Read more about what I’m doing here.

      Awkward Asshole is the brainchild of my uber-talented BFF Shelby Gram. Sometime in 2012 she started illustrating painfully true comics based on…me. They were much needed reminders for how I");
            WriteLiteral(@" can be totally ridiculous and kind of an asshole at times. She continues to show me how to find humor and acceptance in the parts of myself I struggle with. She also gave me the perfect theme for this blog.
      </p>
      <p>
      Life is hard and awkward. The only thing I know for certain is that being able to laugh at yourself makes life a hell of a lot easier.
